# Week 2 Assignment: FOSS Survey Results #

### Project 1: EverPad https://github.com/nvbn/everpad ###
<p> As a Linux user, I am forced to use the web app version of Evernote to take and review class notes, recipes, and articles of interest. While the Evernote rarely discusses developing or future projects, it appears that there are no current plans for a native Linux client. While the Windows version can be run in Wine, there exists a few projects to bring an Evernote client to Linux including one called Everpad. EverPad leverages Evernote's API to allow for the creation, modification and syncing of notes between a Linux machine and the user's Evernote account in the cloud on the official Evernote servers. </p>

<p>Reviewing the commits from both the lead developer, nvbn, and the Everpad community, it appears that the number and frequency of commits has dwindled since their peak in May of 2013.  That said, the developer appears interested in accepting pull requests for bug fixes as recently as June 7th. </p>

<p>As it is a very small project at the moment, EverPad lacks a developer mailing list but does have a small wiki on installing and developing for the project. This wiki includes basic information on the use of the API, installation of the project as well as it's dependencies, and debugging best practices. </p>

<p>The code appears to be written predominantly in Python with clear organization and structure as well as a small test suite. The code follows best practices to ensure good readability but has comparatively few comments within the code making it somewhat difficult but not impossible to follow. The absence of comments provide an opportunity to contribute. </p>

<p>EverPad is used by a subset of both Evernote and Linux users. Ubuntu, one of the most widely used Linux distros recently released a Long Term Stable version, 14.04, and users of many applications, EverPad included, have been submitting bug-fix requests as a result. 14.04's LTS status means it will have a large install base and will be supported for many years. This means it is critical to the survival of the project that as many bugs with 14.04 are squashed. There are several competing Evernote clients for Linux but none dominate the field as of yet. These facts provide opportunities for contributions and collaboration. </p>

<p>In summary, EverPad would benefit from bug fixes to ensure its installation base as well as code commenting to encourage additional developer support. As the number of commits have declined in the past months, it is critical developer interest returns for the survival of the project. </p>
