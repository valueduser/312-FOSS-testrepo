## Project 1: EverPad https://github.com/nvbn/everpad ##
<p>As a Linux user, I am forced to use the web app version of Evernote to take and review class notes. There exists a project to bring an Evernote client to Linux called Everpad. Reviewing the commits from both the lead developer, nvbn, and the Everpad community it appears that the number of commits has dwindled however, the developer appears interested in accepting pull requests for bug fixes as recently as June 7th. </p>
<p>As it is a very small project at the moment, it lacks a developer mailing list but does have a small wiki on installing and developing for the project. This wiki includes basic information on the use of the API, installation of the project as well as it's dependencies, and debugging best practices. </p>
